# 106-FinalProject
A project originally developed in April of 2015 for my Introductory coding class, this functions as a Family Feud-esque game, guessing the common tags associated with your choice in tag. Uses an outdated version of Instagram's API, so it's no longer able to run unless more access than sandbox mode allows is obtained.
